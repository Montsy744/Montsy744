## 👀 About me

I’m a web development enthusiast who loves turning ideas into clean, functional, and visually polished interfaces.
Currently sharpening my skills through personal projects, with a strong interest in front-end development, while expanding into back-end with Java.

I care a lot about details, structure, and code quality — because good UX starts with good code.

## ⚡ Fun fact — Story mode

🧪 The CSS Ritual
What starts as “just fixing a margin” often turns into a 2-hour journey of refining spacing, alignment, and animations…
I don’t stop when it works — I stop when it feels right.
Yes, that includes fixing a button at 3 AM because it’s off by 2 pixels 🎯
